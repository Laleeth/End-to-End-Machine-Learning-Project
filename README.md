# Real world data science project
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the sales of various features [Will update soon].

Folder Structure:
The project has the following folder structure:

### SRC: This folder contains the source code for the project. It includes sub-folders:

###  Components: This folder contains the implementation of various components of the machine learning model like data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
### Pipeline: This folder contains the implementation of the pipeline to execute the machine learning model.
###  Exception: This folder contains the implementation of custom exception handling.
###  Utilis: This folder contains various utility functions used across the project.
###  Logging: This folder contains the implementation of logging for the project.
### DATA: This folder contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model.

DOC: This folder contains the project documentation, including the project proposal, project report, and user manual.

SETUP.py: This file contains the basic setup for the project, including dependencies and required packages.

Setup:
To set up the project, you need to:

Clone the project repository
Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the project using the command: python main.py
The main.py file is the entry point for the project, and it executes the machine learning pipeline.

Conclusion:
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the sales depending on various features. The project has a well-defined folder structure and a basic setup file to get started with the project
